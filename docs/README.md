9. [Testing and debugging](9_testing.md)
10. [Shipping your own code](10_extensions.md)
11. [Settings inside the app](11_settings.md)
12. [Reading obfuscated objects](12_bindings.md)
13. [Raw bytecode](13_bytecode.md)
14. [Hermes JavaScript](14_hermes.md)

The API reference lists every public type and member:

- [Patches](reference.md): declaring patches, options, and what a patch sees while it runs
- [Targets and points](reference_targets.md): finding methods, classes, fields, instructions, and values
- [Code blocks](reference_code.md): adding code, values, extension bindings, and app-wide changes
- [Manifest, resources, and files](reference_files.md)
- [Settings](reference_settings.md): settings, the settings screen, gates, and brands
- [Hermes](reference_hermes.md): JavaScript functions in React Native apps
- [Raw bytecode](reference_dex.md): methods, classes, and instructions as data
- [App runtime](reference_runtime.md): what your extensions call inside the app
- [Gradle plugin](reference_gradle.md): plugins, settings, and build properties

Look things up in [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) and the [glossary](glossary.md).

Engine internals for contributors are in [internals/](internals/).
